# Authorization and Authentication

This module provides mechanisms for user authentication and authorization within the application. Authentication verifies the identity of users, typically through login credentials such as username and password. Authorization determines the access levels and permissions granted to authenticated users, ensuring that only users with the appropriate roles can access specific resources or perform certain actions.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure login and session management to verify user identities.
- **Role-Based Authorization:** Assigns roles to users and restricts access to resources based on these roles.
- **Token Management:** Utilizes tokens (such as JWT) for stateless authentication and authorization.
- **Access Control:** Implements middleware or guards to protect routes and endpoints from unauthorized access.
- **Password Security:** Ensures passwords are stored securely using hashing algorithms.
- **Error Handling:** Provides clear error messages for authentication and authorization failures.

## Usage

1. **Register Users:** Allow new users to create accounts with secure password handling.
2. **Login:** Authenticate users and issue tokens for session management.
3. **Protect Routes:** Use authorization checks to restrict access to sensitive endpoints.
4. **Role Management:** Assign and manage user roles to control permissions.

## Best Practices

- Always hash and salt passwords before storing them.
- Use HTTPS to protect authentication data in transit.
- Regularly update and rotate authentication tokens.
- Implement logging and monitoring for authentication and authorization events.
